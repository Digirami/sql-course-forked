Airports Exercise 

Data source: https://ourairports.com/data/
Data dictionary: https://ourairports.com/help/data-dictionary.html

In this exercise we analyse the countries, airports and airports_frequencies table
These have  matching columns: 
* airports.ident matches airport_frequencies.airport_ident
* countries.code matches airports.iso_country
*/

-- Show 10 sample rows of the airports table
SELECT 	TOP 10 * FROM 	countries c;

SELECT 	TOP 10 * FROM 	airports a;

-- Show 10 sample rows of the airports_frequencies table
SELECT 	TOP 10 * FROM airport_frequencies af;

-- These are the more interesting columns of the airports table  that we use in this exercise

Do a data quality check on the airports_frequencies table
Are there any orphan rows (frequencies without a matching airports)?
You can do this is several ways: LEFT JOIN, NOT IN, NOT EXISTS,...
