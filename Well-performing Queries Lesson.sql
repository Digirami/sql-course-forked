Guidelines for well-performing SQL queries
Note: Best to use SSMS so can see  query plans (DBeaver community edition does not seem to allow this)

This lesson uses several tables in the LearnSQL database

The PricePaidSW12 table has 
* a PK on TransactionID, 
* FKs on PostCode and PropertyType 
* additional indexes on Postcode and TransactionDate

The PostCodeSW12 has a PK on the pcds column.
This is the postcode format that matches the PostCode column in PricePaidSW12 table
*/

/*
Indexes speed up data retrieval.  Put indexes on columns in JOIN / WHERE / ORDER BY clauses
Compare the statistics and the estimated query plan with the WHERE clause 
on columns that have an index e.g. Postcode  and columns that do not e.g. PAON
