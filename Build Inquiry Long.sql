/*
This lesson shows how to disaggregate a period table .  This is a common problem.

A period table typically has a row for a period, typically defined by a StartDate and EndDate column.
Different rows have different periods with different start and end date values.
Each period has some numerical value, say Amount, associated with the entire period. 

We need to calculate the sum of the Amount over all rows and typically by calendar periods (year, quarter, month etc) that do not align with 
the periods in the table.

To do this we need to disaggregate the data down to a daily granularity then aggregate the data back up to the required 
calendar level with a Dates dimension table in the usual way.

Here are the steps
We first need to define the DailyAmount, the Amount divided by the number of days in the period (+1 if the  start and end dates are inclusive)
We then need to split each period row into a row for each date in the period
For example, if for a particular row, the StartDate is '2024-01-01' and the EndDate is '2024-01-31' we would need to create 31 rows 
with a new [Date] column between '2024-01-01'  '2024-01-31
