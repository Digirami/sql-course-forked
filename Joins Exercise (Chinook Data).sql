-- To get you started, here are the SQL statements to retrieve the relevant columns of the Invoice, Customer and Employee tables
SELECT
	i.InvoiceId
	, i.CustomerId
	, i.InvoiceDate
	, i.Total
FROM
	Invoice i

	SELECT
	c.CustomerId
	, c.FirstName

	, c.City
FROM
	Customer c

	e.EmployeeId
	, e.FirstName
	, e.LastName
FROM
	Employee e
	
/*
Task: 
(1) List all invoices (InvoiceId, CustomerId, InvoiceDate, Total).
(2) Add corresponding customer columns (FirstName, LastName, City).
(3) Filter to customers in London and Paris.
(4) Each customer has an employee that is assigned as a support rep. Add the corresponding employee names.
    Note that the common columns are Customer.SupportRepId and Employee.EmployeeId
    As both Customer and Employee tables have FirstName and LastName columns, use column aliases to differentiate .
(5) Concatenate the employee FirstName and LastName into a single EmployeeName calculated column.  
    Create a CustomerName column in the same way
