/*
Subqueries Exercise 2 - Correlated

A correlated subquery in SQL is a subquery that references columns from the outer query, 
It is executed once for each row processed by the outer query. 
The subquery is re-evaluated for every row, making it useful for row-by-row comparisons 
but potentially less efficient than non-correlated subqueries.

This next tasks use two related tables
* PricePaidSW12 - sales of properties in London SW12 from 1995 to 2019. 
* PropertyTypeLookup - a lookup table on the PropertyType column of PricePaidSW12.  This contains a one letter code e.g. 'D'.  

The PropertyTypeLookup has a column PropertyTypeCode with matching values and a column PropertyTypeName with the description e.g. 'Detached'

The queries focus sales on a particular street, Ranmere Street
