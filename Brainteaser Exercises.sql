We have been told that the MessageId column has unique and contiguous values  
i.e. there are no dupicates and no missing values (so no gaps in the sequence of MessageId values).

There are three tasks:
1. Check for duplicates in the MessageId column
2. Differentiate between identical and conflicting duplicates
3. Check for missing MessageId values
*/

/*
Task 1:  Let's check for duplicates in the MessageId column. If there are duplicates, 
(1) list the duplicate MessageId values and the number of times they are duplicated
(2) list (all columns of) the duplicated rows

Consider two approaches; one that uses Window functions and one that does not.
